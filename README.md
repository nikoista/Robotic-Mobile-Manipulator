# Robotic-Mobile-Manipulator

In this project we try to find:
 - The Jacobian Matrix which describes our Mobile Manipulator with 9 Degree's of Freedom 
 - Visualise our Mobile Manipulator doing basic tasks like grabing objects in a 
   well calculated space using Matlab and Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox.
